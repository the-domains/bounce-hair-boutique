Her professional career is grounded in a dual passion for design and helping clients love their hair.

She describes these training experiences and the introduction Curly Girl method and way of life as a "breath of fresh air" and an affirmation to why she "loves the industry so much." 
In 2011, Jennessa joined the DevaCurl team as a DevaCurl Regional Guest Artist.
