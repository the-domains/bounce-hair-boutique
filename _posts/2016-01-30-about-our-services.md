The DevaCut 

This revolutionary cutting technique was designed for curls, waves and all natural textures. Hair is sculpted curl-by-curl, while dry, in its natural state according to your lifestyle, personality and preferences. This service includes a curl coaching session and a personalized DevaCurl product prescription that makes it easy to maintain your style at home.  

How do I prepare for a DevaCut? 

Your stylist will use our signature dry-cutting technique, so please arrive at the salon with your curls detangled and dry, in their natural state. Before your appointment, it's best to let your hair hang loosely---avoid ponytail holders or clips. 

Pintura Highlighting 

This award-winning technique was designed to add gorgeous, light-reflecting highlights to curls. Pintura Highlighting offers the perfect harmony and balance to curls giving brilliance and dimension to perfectly compliment your DevaCut. 

No-Poo Curl Transformation 

The beauty of this service is the customized design for every client. The luxurious process begins with a thorough cleanse and conditioning. Next, your stylist will shape and style your curls the way you want them to fit your lifestyle. This service is perfect for those who want to embrace their curls, and learn the fundamentals of daily curl care.
